# Frontend Mentor - Manage landing page solution

This is a solution to the [Manage landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/manage-landing-page-SLXqC6P5). 


##Goal 

this is my second repository for this project. I have discovered SASS, and wish to abandon all of of my CSS for learning sass. 

Kevin Powell does a fantastic job with this challenge; I will be following his tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3bTwCqX4ns , Except I will be replacing all of the CSS with SASS.
